        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Recipe taken from: <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/hamburger-steak-hambagu/">Just One Cookbook</a></p>
        <p>Hamburger steak or <em>hambagu</em>, is a "steak" made from ground meat served typically with rice instead of buns. It is one of many popular <em>yooshoku</em> (Japanese style western food) dishes and can be served in a number of slight variations, from sautéed mushrooms and onions, with démi-glace sauce, or a fried egg.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>oil</li>
            <li>ground beef & pork</li>
            <li>panko</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>red wine</li>
            <li>egg</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the onion finely. Start by slicing the onion towards the root with 1/4 inch parallel cuts. Then cut perpendicular to the root again with 1/4 inch parallel cuts.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat and add the onion when ready. Sauté until tender and almost translucent.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, take the sautéed onions and add the ground beef and pork with the salt, pepper and nutmeg. Then add the milk, panko and egg.</li>
            <li>Mix the ingredients all together. With a silicone spatula. Switch to kneading the mixture with your hands until it is sticky and pale.</li>
            <li>Divide the hamburger mixture into 4-6 pieces. Take each piece to make a patty.</li>
            <li>With each patty, toss it from one hand to the other for about 5 times to release the air inside the mixture to prevent cracks while cooking. Then shape then into an oval.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to cook them, heat up oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the patties until they are brown on the bottom (~3 minutes) and flip over to cook until brown on the other side.</li>
            <li>Add red wine and reduce the heat to low heat. Cover with a lid and cook for 5-7 minutes in order to cook the inside of the patties.</li>
        </ol>
